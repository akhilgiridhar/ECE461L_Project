### Description: 
Our team has implemented a Proof of Concept (PoC) for a web application for a functioning HaaS system. The web app allows users to log in to or create secure user accounts, create and join projects, check in and out hardware sets, and view the status of all hardware resources in the system. We have utilized React for the frontend, Flask for the backend, and MongoDB as our database. After logging in, the user is taken to a dashboard of all projects they are a part of along with the hardware status for those projects. They can then choose to check in/check out hardware sets or leave the project. The user is also given the option to create a new project or join an existing one given a project ID. And finally they are able to log out. Give it a try!

### Instructions: 
To run this project please run the following commands:
- pip3 install pymongo
- pip3 install flask
- pip3 install flask-cors
- npm install
- python3 app.py
- npm start

Run the last two commands in separate terminals but make sure to run the python3 command before npm start.
